What is prune in Fetch?
Answer: The Git prune command is much like an internal housekeeping utility that cleans up unreachable Git objects. It is useful when there are a lot many files or commits in our working directory that we don't want to keep. If an object or commit is no more reachable from the current branch, git prune will delete that object or commit from the working directory. It is a way to make the directory lighter and easier to track the progress of the project.
